This submission includes 3 files: index.html, nodice.html, and dice.html 

I originally tried to used media types "Screen and (min color:_), but that didn't work. 

I also tried to to use the display: non attribute which didn't work so I tried to make the "NO" the same color as the background so it wouldn't be visible. I understand the point of the assignment and
will be sure to re-examine it when I have time. Thanks!!
