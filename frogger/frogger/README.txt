Kristen Ford Assignment 4

Basic Requirements:
1. The game does load immediately as soon as the page is loaded. 
2. Frogger can move up, down, and side to side on the canvas.
3. The vehicles and logs are animated using a timer which moves them a certain distance at each time step.
4. My code detects if frogger has been hit by a car or touches water using the collision detection function and 
decrements the froggers life. 
5. The basic scoring has been implemented: 10 points for going up, 50 for going home and 1000 for jumping all 5 frogs home

Additional: 
1. A dead frog png is shown every time frogger dies
2. alligators, turtles, and snakes serve as other obstacles the could kill frogger 
3. When the players jumps all five frogs home the level is incremented and the speed of the vehicles and logs is increased

All of these features are implemented correctly. This took me about 10 hours to do. I worked alone on this project.
