==================
Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
I believe all of this assignment was done correctly. I was able to learn from my mistakes in the dice no dice lab to figure how to
implement responsive design. I'M SO HAPPY!
Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
I worked alone on this assignment.
Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
It took me in total about 6 hours to complete because I was extremely confused about how to use github so that took me a while 
even though the assignment itself wasn't that difficult.
